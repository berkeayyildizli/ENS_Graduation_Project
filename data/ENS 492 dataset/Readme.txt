- This unlabeled dataset corresponds to different depositions based on the Inconel 718 alloy.

	+ Total number of thermal images: 2317 frames 

	+ Thermal image resolution: 164 x 218 pixels	

	+ IN718 melting point: 1260 - 1336 Â°C


Note: There might be a few frames without melt pools inside. They can be discarded since they correspond to the transition from one layer into another layer.
